Retrieve timeseries from the [CBS open data interface](http://www.cbs.nl/nl-NL/menu/cijfers/statline/open-data/default.htm)
interface, employing package [cbsodataR](https://github.com/edwindj/cbsodataR)

# Introduction

Package [cbsodataR](https://github.com/edwindj/cbsodataR) can be used
to retrieve data of CBS tables using R code. Most tables are complex multi-dimensional tables,
and extracting timeseries with appropriate names will usually require 
some further R programming. The purpose of `cbsots` is to take this programming off your hands.

The packages provides the Shiny App "CBS Timeseries Coding" for specifying which portions
of the table you want to retrieve and how the names of the individual timeseries
should be constructed, and a separate function `get_ts` for actually creating the 
timeseries based on the timeseries coding created with the Shiny App. The timeseries
coding created in the Shiny App is stored in an rds file.

# Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# first install library drat if you have not installed that library yet:
install.packages("drat")

# now install cbsots with the timemod drat Repository
drat::addRepo("timemod")
install.packages("cbsots")
```

# The Shiny App "CBS Timeseries Coding`

```{r include = FALSE}

```

The Shiny application is started by calling the function `edit_ts_code`.
For example, 
```{r eval = FALSE}
library(cbsots)
edit_ts_code("tscode.rds")
```

The first argument (`"tscode.rds"`) specifies the name of the rds file were the 
timeseries coding is stored. The file does not have to exist yet. If it does
not exist, then the file is created when the timeseries coding is saved.

More information about the Shiny App "CBS Timeseries Coding" will be provided in 
a future Tutorial and a Manual, which unfortunately still have to be written.
Here I only give a simple example for a table `70076NED` (consumption
in the Netherlands).  Here is an example of the Shiny App with already 
specified timeseries coding:

![70076NED_Topic](readme_data/CBS Timeseries Coding.png)
This table has two dimensions: "Topic" and "GoederenEnDiensten" (assets and ervices),
besides of the time dimension (years, quarters etc.) that is disregarded in the Shiny App. 
Every CBS table has a dimension called "Topic", and usually has one or more extra dimensions,
such as "GoederenEnDiensten" for this table.
For this particular table, the different Topics correspond to different types of 
consumption timeseries: volumemutaties (volume changes), waardemutaties (value changes),
and indexcijfers (indices) for both volume and value.
Each Topic has a *Key* (a short identifier)
and a *Title* (a more detailed description). The *Select* and *Code* columns are the
columns that can be modified. In this example, we are only interest in indices
for both volumes and values, so only the corresponding entries have been selected.
The text in the *Code* column is used to create the timeseries
names, as explained below.

Let us now have a look at the tab for dimension "GoederenEnDiensten" (Assets and Services):

![70076NED_Topic](readme_data/CBS Timeseries Coding_GoederenEnDiensten.png)


For this dimension I have select  "Consumptie binnenland" (domestic consumption),
"Goederen" (assets) and "Diensten" (services).

#### Timeseries names

Function `get_ts` will create a timeseries for each  
combination of selected "Topics" and "GoederenEnDiensten". The names of the timeseries
are created by pasting the texts in the Code columns for each dimension.
In this case, the codes for "Topic" are the suffixes and the
codes for `GoederenEnDiensten` are the prefixes. So the names of the timeseries
will be `c___vi`, `c_govi`, `c_divi`,  `c___wi`, `c_giwi`, `c_divi`. 
Which dimension is used for the prefixes and which dimension for the suffixes 
of the timeseries names is determined by the ordering of the buttons above the 
dimension table. See the selection of the Shiny App below:

![70076NED_buttons](readme_data/CBS Timeseries Coding_order_buttons.png)

The ordering the these buttons can be changed: move the mouse cursor to the button `GoederenEnDiensten`,
then press the left mouse button and drag it to the right of button `Topic`. Now you can release
the button. As a result you will get:

![70076NED_buttons](readme_data/CBS Timeseries Coding_order_buttons_2.png)

For this ordering the the timeseries names would become `vic___`, `vic_di `, 
etc.

After making any changes to the timeseries coding, you should press the
`Save codes` button on the lower left corner of the Shiny App.
The Shiny App does not automatically save changes.

# Function get_ts

To create the timseries, we first read the timeseries coding created by the 
Shiny App:
```{r}
ts_code <- readRDS("tscode.rds")
```

Then function `get_ts` can be used to finally create the timeseries:

```{r}
# Return only yearly and quarterly series (skip monthly series) and 
# starting from 2017
data <- get_ts("70076NED", ts_code, frequencies = "yq",
               min_year = "2017")
```

The result is a list with class `table_ts`, with com-ponents `"Y"` (annual timeseries)
and `"Q"` (quarterly timeseries):
```{r}
data
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
unlink("raw_cbs_data", recursive = TRUE)
unlink("tscode.rds")
```
